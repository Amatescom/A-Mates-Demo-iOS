# A-Mates Demo iOS

**A-mates** is a powerful and cost-effective tool that enables you to incorporate a forum-like community section into your mobile app. Simply integrate our SDK into your iOS or Android app, customize it in seconds, place an entrance button wherever you prefer, and your very own community is ready to roll! Learn more about us or join us on [a-mates.com](https://a-mates.com/) to get started.

This demo version helps you understand how the A-mates SDK works within the iOS app. 

To get started, make sure you have a Community AppID. If you don't have one, create an  [A-mates account](https://space.a-mates.com/register)  to get your unique Community AppID.

As soon as you ready to integrate SDK to your app, please, refer to our [Integration Guide](https://a-mates.notion.site/616e378c46cd4dd495f8b82e0ac6d571?v=b0e48932828e4a41a601b9d03c126d99).
